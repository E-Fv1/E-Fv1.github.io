        <h1>How to fly a plane</h1>
        <p>For this guide I will be using the default bindings on keyboard/mouse. You can use a controller or a joystick, but I don't becase my controller is around <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2000/07/05/interact-hammerhead-fx-review">20 years old</a>, and I don't have a joystick.</p>
        <img src="images/keycontrol.jpg" width="75%">
        <p id="1step">To start up the plane so you can start moving use {RIGHT SHIFT + L} for electricity then {RIGHT SHIFT + HOME} to start engines. After that use {RIGHT CONTROL + C} to close the cockpit, {LEFT SHIFT + F} to have flaps in landing/takeoff position. Wait for the green lights that I zoom into to turn off to use {PGUP/PGDOWN} to increase and decrease throttle. It should be around 4 on indicator thingy both above and below</p>
		<p id="2step">Basic controls are {Z} or {R} for using the rudder to turn left and right. To bank left and right use {ARROWKEY LEFT} or {ARROWKEY RIGHT}. To pitch up and down use {ARROWKEY UP} or {ARROWKEY LEFT}. To slow your movement you can use {B} to toggle the airbrake.</p>
		Try to get at LEAST 170kmph
